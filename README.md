### Bootstrapping 
>CAUTION: The bootstrap.sh script will install/remove docker and its containers on any linux node (tested on Ubuntu 18.04). DO NOT execute it on production or any important node.

To bootstrap any node excute the following command:
```sh
$ sudo chmod ug+x ./bootstrap.sh
$ sudo ./bootstrap
```

### Task Execution
1. Created a vanilla KVM instance "jenkins-master"
2. Configured Git and cloned the following https://github.com/nusrath432/aquasec.git repo which has:
	a. bootstrap.sh script - installs docker, jenkins master in a docker container on any linux node [tested only on Ubuntu 18.04]
	b. Dockerfile - Has defination of the image to be build and pushed to hub.docker.io
	c. Readme.md - Instructions file
3. Executed bootstrap.sh to install Jenkins Docker container
4. Launched Jenkins GUI and created build-docker-images-freestyle & build-docker-images-pipeline with build trigger (GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling)
   Note: Since the KVM is running on my work laptop, the webhook on my git repository [http://91.189.88.154:8080/github-webhook/  (push)] is not accessible. Hence, I had to run the build manually.
5. On build execution, the git repository nusrath432/aquasec from github gets cloned to /var/jenkins_home/workspace/build-docker-images-freestyle within jenkin container and then pushed to the hub.docker.io registry with tag as nusrath432/aquasec:<$GIT_COMMIT>

### Docker Hub
https://cloud.docker.com/repository/registry-1.docker.io/nusrath432/aquasec/tags


### Challenges Faced
1. In general, setting up this workflow took some time as I have not used Docker or Jenkins before.
2. Bootstraping and running docker commands as non-sudo user without logging-out of the current session.
3. Mounting the  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock and using the unix:///var/run/docker.sock for authentication - didn't work until I restarted the jenkin-master container.
4. Took some significant time to figure out how to run docker within docker container - used -v $(which docker):/usr/bin/docker
5. Getting the hub.docker.io authenticated via Jenkin GUI was difficult even when using the right credentials - had to use the Docker registry URL: https://index.docker.io/v1/ to get it working.
